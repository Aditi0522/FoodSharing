2. **Fresh Ingredients**: Ensuring customer reliability by using fresh ingredients.
3. **Recyclable Materials**: Use of recyclable paper, plastic, and aluminum materials.
4. **Community Service**: Food is made available at half the price, benefiting both restaurants and the community.
5. **Reducing Food Waste**:

    - Donating to communities in need.
    - Proper storage techniques to reduce spoilage.

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Quality Assurance**:
